const name = "Burhan"

console.log(`My name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`); //work as f-string in python

const college = new String("UMT") //this is another way to declare a string by using this string store with index as in array and we can access any index value of string
console.log(college);

console.log(college[1]); //output = 'M' because M is at index 1 of college

console.log(college.toLowerCase()); //we access to multiple functions of string using . with variable name
